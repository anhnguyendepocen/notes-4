\chapter{Non-parametric methods}\label{chap:nonparametric}

%% intro
%A typical problem in statistics is to estimate the distribution of a random variable from a set of observations. 
%
%\smallskip 
So far we have assumed that the parametric form of the distribution is known, for example $X\sim\text{Bernoulli}(\theta)$ where $\theta\in[0,1]$ is unknown or $X\sim\text{Poisson}(\theta)$ where $\theta>0$ is unknown. We now look at methods for estimating the distribution of a random variable where the parametric form of the distribution is not known. Such methods are called \emph{non-parametric} or \emph{distribution-free} methods.

\smallskip
We consider only continuous distributions, so we can assume that the inverse CDF $F^{-1}(u)$ exists for all $u\in[0,1]$ and that the probability of different observations taking the same value is zero.
